                                                                   task 1 - scan your local network for open ports

*Step 1 - In Cmd use ipconfig command and take the ip address.
*Step 2 - After that we are perform nmap scan using command: nmap -sS 172.90.10.0/24 for TCP SYN scan.

**Device 1: 172.90.10.15**

| Port  | Service     | Risk Level      | Recommendation                                                                                                                                 |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 21/tcp| FTP         | High            | Disable if not needed. Use SFTP/FTPS. Enforce strong authentication, restrict access, patch regularly. 
                                          FTP transmits data in plaintext, making credentials easily interceptable by attackers.                                                                                                
| 53/tcp| Domain (DNS)| Moderate-High   | Ensure DNS server is properly secured. Disable zone transfers, restrict recursion, apply latest security patches, and monitor logs.
                                          Exposed DNS can be targeted for exploits, amplification attacks, or information gathering.                                                                 

**Explanation:**
- **Port 21 (FTP):** Standard FTP is highly insecure as it transmits credentials unencrypted. Open FTP ports are frequently targeted for anonymous access or brute-forcing.
- **Port 53 (TCP DNS):** Legitimate for DNS servers, but attackers often exploit DNS services for reconnaissance, denial of service, or data exfiltration if not properly configured.

**Device 2: 172.90.10.25**

| Port    | Service       | Risk Level   | Recommendation                                                                                                                                 |

| 135/tcp | MSRPC         | High         | Block externally if not required. Apply latest security patches. Segregate network, limit access to trusted hosts. 
                                           Port used for Microsoft RPC; often abused in malware propagation and lateral movement.                                                                                      
| 139/tcp | NetBIOS-SSN   | High         | Should not be accessible from untrusted networks. Disable if not in use, segment network, block on perimeter firewalls. 
                                           NetBIOS can expose file sharing and authentication vulnerabilities.                                                                                                    
| 445/tcp | Microsoft-DS  | High         | Critical to secure. Restrict access, patch, and disable SMBv1. 
                                           Used for SMB file and printer sharing; frequent vector for ransomware and worms (e.g., EternalBlue, WannaCry)                                                                                                                  

**Explanation:**
- **Ports 135, 139, 445:** All associated with Windows networking, remote management, and file sharing. 
- Exposure to untrusted networks creates a high risk for exploitation, as seen in past widespread attacks. 
- These should not be open to the wider internet, and network segmentation and firewall rules are essential.

**General Recommendations:**
- Limit exposure of these ports/services to internal/trusted networks only.
- Regularly patch operating systems and related services.
- Use encryption and secure protocols where possible (e.g., SFTP instead of FTP).
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity on these ports.
- Disable unused services to minimize attack surface.
