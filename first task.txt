Task :01
Device 1: 172.20.78.2
Host is up (0.0088s latency).
Open Ports:
21/tcp → ftp
53/tcp → domain (DNS)
(Unknown vendor)

Port

21

53

Service

Risk
Level

Explanation
FTP is unencrypted; usernames and passwords can be
intercepted. It's an old protocol vulnerable to sniffing and
brute-force attacks.

FTP

High

DNS

If this is an open DNS server, it could be misused for DNS
Medium amplification DDoS attacks. If it's internal-only, it's less
risky.

Recommendations
•
•

Replace or disable FTP. Use SFTP (over SSH) or FTPS (with TLS) for secure file
transfer.
Restrict DNS access to internal (LAN) devices only. Block external access
unless it’s a secure, configured DNS server.

Device 2: 172.20.78.8
Host is up (0.0022s latency).
Open Ports:
- 135/tcp: msrpc
- 139/tcp: netbios-ssn
- 445/tcp: microsoft-ds

Risk
Level

Explanation

High

Remote Procedure Call used by Windows. Vulnerable to
exploits like DCOM or lateral movement techniques if not
properly secured.

139 NetBIOS-SSN High

Legacy file sharing protocol. Exposes network shares and
can be a target for SMB relay and man-in-the-middle
attacks.

Microsoft-DS Very
(SMB)
High

Common attack vector for ransomware (e.g., WannaCry,
EternalBlue). Should never be exposed to the internet.

Port

Service

135 MSRPC

445

Recommendations
Disable NetBIOS and SMBv1 if not needed (especially on modern networks).
Block ports 135, 139, and 445 from public networks using a firewall. Only allow inside
trusted LANs.
Restrict file sharing services to specific devices using access control lists (ACLs).
Apply all Windows security patches to prevent known RPC/SMB vulnerabilities.

Conclusion

FTP, NetBIOS, and SMB are serious exposure risks on a local network.
Where services are not in use, they should be disabled or firewalled.
All systems should be patched and monitored to prevent exploitation.
