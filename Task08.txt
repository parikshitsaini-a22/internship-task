VPN Setup and Privacy Report
Date: 16 Aug 2025
VPN Service Used: ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
System: Windows 11 Home, Version 23H2

1. Objective
To install and configure a free VPN client on Windows 11, test its ability to encrypt internet traffic and change the public IP address, and evaluate the benefits and limitations of VPN usage.

2. Steps Taken on Windows 11
• Downloaded Client: Opened Microsoft Edge → Navigated to ProtonVPN.com → Downloaded ProtonVPN Windows installer.
• Installation: Installed ProtonVPN client with default settings. Allowed it through Windows Security Firewall when prompted.
• Login: Launched ProtonVPN and signed in using my free Proton account.
• Connecting to VPN: From the main dashboard, selected a free server (Netherlands – Free #3) and clicked Connect. The app showed a green “Connected” status.
• Verifying IP Address: Opened Edge → visited whatismyipaddress.com.
• Before VPN: Displayed my ISP-assigned India-based IP.
• After VPN: Displayed a Netherlands IP, confirming VPN masking.
• Browsing Test: Accessed Wikipedia and YouTube. Pages loaded normally but video buffering was slightly slower compared to normal browsing.
• Disconnect: Clicked Disconnect in ProtonVPN. Re-checked [whatismyipaddress.com] — IP reverted to ISP’s original address.

3. Observations
• IP Masking: Worked as expected — original IP successfully hidden.
• Encryption: ProtonVPN free uses AES-256 encryption with OpenVPN/IKEv2 protocols, ensuring secure browsing.
• Performance: Normal web browsing was fine, but streaming speed dropped slightly while connected.
• Windows 11 Integration: VPN ran smoothly, minimized to taskbar, and worked with Windows 11 firewall without extra configuration.

Research on VPN Encryption & Privacy
• ProtonVPN free encrypts all traffic with AES-256 + 4096-bit RSA + SHA256.
• Prevents ISP monitoring and packet sniffing on public Wi-Fi.
• Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks by tunneling traffic securely.

6. Benefits of VPNs (Windows 11 Context)
• Secures traffic even on public Wi-Fi hotspots.
• Helps bypass regional restrictions in browsers like Edge/Chrome.
• Adds a privacy layer when Windows telemetry and tracking are a concern.
7. Limitations of VPNs
• Free servers often experience congestion, leading to slower speeds.
• VPN provider must be trusted since all traffic passes through their servers.
• Some apps (like banking software) may block VPN connections.

Conclusion
The VPN was successfully installed and tested on Windows 11. The IP address masking and traffic encryption were confirmed, and while there was a minor performance drop, the VPN significantly improved privacy and security.
