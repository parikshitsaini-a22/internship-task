Suspicious Browser Extension Audit Report
Date: 15 Aug 2025
Browser Used: Google Chrome 127.0.6533.88

1. Objective
The purpose of this task was to review all installed browser extensions, identify any that may be suspicious, unused, or unnecessary, and remove them to improve browser security and performance.

2. Steps Taken
• Opened the Chrome menu → Extensions → Manage Extensions.
• Reviewed the full list of installed extensions.
• Checked each extension’s permissions, developer information, and recent reviews on the Chrome Web Store.
• Compared installed extensions against known safe tools I use regularly.
• Flagged extensions that had excessive permissions, no longer needed functionality, or questionable origins.
• Removed flagged extensions.
• Restarted the browser and monitored performance.

3. Findings
During the review, four extensions were installed. Two were legitimate and regularly used:
• uBlock Origin – Verified safe, widely trusted ad-blocker.
• Grammarly – Verified safe writing assistant.
Two extensions were flagged for removal:
• Quick PDF Converter Pro – Requested full access to all websites, had multiple negative reviews citing intrusive ads and tracking behavior.
• WeatherTab – Displayed weather on new tabs but also injected unrelated ads, had questionable developer contact info.
Both suspicious extensions were removed.

4. Performance Changes
After removal, browser startup time felt slightly faster, and the frequency of pop-up ads decreased. No unexpected redirects were observed during browsing.

5. Risks of Malicious Browser Extensions
Malicious or overly-permissive extensions can:
• Inject ads or redirect traffic for profit.
• Steal login credentials and session cookies.
• Track user activity and sell browsing history.
• Download additional malicious scripts.

Conclusion
The audit identified and removed two potentially harmful extensions, improving both security and performance. Regular review of installed browser extensions is critical to minimizing security risks, especially as legitimate-looking extensions can turn malicious after updates or developer changes.
